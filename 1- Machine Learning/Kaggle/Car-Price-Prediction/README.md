# Car price prediction project with a linear regression model





## project steps:
1-Doing an initial exploratory data analysis with Jupyter notebooks

2-Setting up a validation framework 

3-Implementing the linear regression model from scratch 

4-Performing simple feature engineering for the model 

5-Keeping the model under control with regularization

6-Using the model to predict car prices

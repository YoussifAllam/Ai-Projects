# About Dataset
* Context :

This is the data set used by Gorman and Sejnowski in their study

of the classification of sonar signals using a neural network [1]. 

The task is to train a module to discriminate between sonar signals bounced

off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock.

* Content :
  
The data set contains the response metrics for 60 separate sonar frequencies sent out against a known mine field (and known rocks). These frequencies are then labeled with the known object they were beaming the sound at (either a rock or a mine).

### Churn Prediction

identifying customers who are likely to cancel their contracts soon.

If the company can do that, it can handle users before churn

The target variable that we want to predict is categorical and has only two possible outcomes: churn or not churn (Binary Classification).

We also would like to understand why the model thinks our customers churn, and for that, we need to be able to interpret the model’s predictions.
